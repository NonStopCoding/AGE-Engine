### AGE-Engine Info
AGE-Engine Stands for Any Gqme Engine which pretty means that i am designing this engine to be able to make it easier for the owner to make it there type of theme by making it basic layout with bootstrap for the design and PHP to work on the backend using MYSQL for database management, not sure which jqyery plugin will be used at the current minute.

AGE-Engine is 100% custom coded from scratch using PDO as the database wrapper to intereact with the database.
